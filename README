Overview
========
[Complete Genomics](http://completegenomics.com) provides whole-genome sequencing using DNA nanoball arrayed sequencing.  They also do a relatively thorough job of primary data analysis, but this analysis focuses on single individuals.  Often, particularly with cancer genomes, there is a need for further analysis such as comparing tumor versus normal or assessing the sharing of variants across samples.
